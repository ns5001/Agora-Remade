# Agora-Remade
Agora connects you with the most budget friendly apartments in New York City. Simply search for the borough of your interest, and instantanously you will find the latest apartment listings starting with the least expensive. You may also sign-up for an Agora account with your email or through your Facebook, to save apartments that interest you and join the Agora community.  After you fork and clone this repo, simply rake db:migrate, and that make sure you rake db:seed. The seed command may take up to 3 minutes to complete, but will not display anything to the terminal screen.
